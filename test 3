# Write a function for checking the speed of driver. 
# this function should have one parameter: speed. 
# 1. If speed is less than 70 km/hr, it should print OK
# 2. Otherwise, for every 5 km per hour more, should give the
# driver one point. Therefore, if the speed is 80, it should 
# print 'Points: 2'
# 3. If the driver has 12 or more points, print "License suspended."
