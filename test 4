# Write a function called showNumbers that takes a parameter called
# limit. It should print all the numbers between 0 and the limit
# with a label to identify the even and odd numbers. For ex, if 
# the limit is 3, it should print: 0 even, 1 odd, 2 even, 3 odd.

    for i in range(0, limit + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            print(i, "EVEN")
        else:
            print(i, "ODD")
